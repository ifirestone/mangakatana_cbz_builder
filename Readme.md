# Manga Katana CBZ Builder from Downloaded Zip Files

- This script is forked from JacquesDuflos/mangakatana_cbz_creater and was updated is meant to turn .zip files downloaded from mangakatana.com to a serie of .cbz files.
- The .zip files contain usually 10 chapters of a same manga stored as a serie of folders.
- The Script will create a .cbz file for each folder in the .zip file.
- The .cbz file will be named as the name of the folder and will contain all the files in this folder.
- The .cbz file will be stored in the same folder as the .zip file.
- The script will also create a folder named "cbz" in the same folder as the .zip file and store all the .cbz files in this folder.
